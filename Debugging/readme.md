1-What are the different types of errors in JavaScript ?

SyntaxError        	Incorrect JavaScript syntax
ReferenceError  	Accessing an undefined variable
TypeError	        Using an operation on the wrong data type
RangeError	        Value out of an acceptable range
EvalError	        Improper use of eval()
URIError	        Incorrect use of encodeURI() or decodeURI()


2-How can you debug a JavaScript program in the browser ?

console.log()	                        Print variables and debug output
DevTools Console	                    Check for errors (F12 > Console)
debugger                                Statement	Pause execution at a specific line
Breakpoints	                            Pause execution at set points (F12 > Sources)
Network Tab	                            Inspect API requests and responses
console.error() & console.warn()	    Log errors and warnings
try...catch	                            Handle exceptions gracefully
Performance                             Tab	Analyze and optimize slow code



3-What is the use of console.log(), and how can it help in debugging?

String Interpolation	    console.log(Hello ${name});	                                                    Inserts variables into strings.
Multiple Values	            console.log("User:", name, age);	                                            Logs multiple values at once.
Styled Output	            console.log("%cStyled Text", "color: red; font-size: 16px");	                Adds CSS styles to logs.
Grouping Logs	            console.group("My Logs"); console.log("Message"); console.groupEnd();	        Groups related logs together.



4-Explain the purpose of try...catch in JavaScript

Prevents Script Crashes – Catches errors before they stop execution.
Improves User Experience – Displays friendly error messages.
Handles Asynchronous Errors – Useful for API calls or JSON parsing.
Ensures Cleanup with finally – Runs necessary cleanup tasks.


5-How do breakpoints help in debugging JavaScript code?

No Need for console.log() – Inspect values directly in DevTools.
Step Through Code Execution – Use Step Over (F10), Step Into (F11), and Resume (F8) to control execution.
Monitor Variable Values – Hover over variables to see their current values.
Check Call Stack & Scope – Analyze function calls and accessible variables.
Debug Performance Issues – Identify slow operations by setting breakpoints in long-running loops.



6-What is the difference between throw and console.error()?


Feature                 	      throw	                                       console.error()

Purpose         	Stops execution and generates an error	        Logs an error message to the console
Execution Flow  	Immediately stops execution	                    Continues execution after logging
Error Handling	    Works with try...catch to handle exceptions	    Does not stop code execution
Use Case	        When you need to signal an actual error     	When you just want to log an error message


8-How can debugger be used in JavaScript?

The debugger statement in JavaScript pauses script execution, allowing developers to inspect variables, step through code, and debug issues using browser DevTools.

Debugging function outputs	✅ Yes
Tracking loop iterations	✅ Yes
Debugging event handlers	✅ Yes
Debugging API responses	✅ Yes
In production code	❌ No (Remove it after debugging)


9-What is stack trace, and how can it help in debugging?

A stack trace is a report or log generated by a program when an error occurs during its execution. It provides detailed information about the sequence of function calls that led to the error, essentially giving you a "snapshot" of the program’s state at the time of the crash.


10-What are some best practices for writing bug-free JavaScript code?


Write Clean and Readable Code

Use meaningful variable and function names.
Maintain consistent indentation and formatting.
Use Strict Mode

Enable 'use strict'; to catch common mistakes.
Avoid Global Variables

Minimize global scope pollution; use namespaces or modules.
Use const and let Instead of var

Use const for constants, let for variables that may change.
Handle Errors Properly

Use try...catch for error handling.
Don't ignore errors; always log or handle them.
Minimize Side Effects

Write pure functions (functions that don’t alter external state).
Avoid mutating function arguments.
Avoid Nested Callback Hell

Use Promises or async/await instead of nested callbacks.
Test Your Code

Write unit tests to validate correctness.
Test for edge cases and unusual inputs.
Avoid Deep Nesting

Reduce nested loops and conditionals for readability.
Refactor complex conditions into simpler functions.
Use Built-In Methods Efficiently

Leverage JavaScript’s built-in functions and libraries to simplify tasks.
Optimize Performance

Avoid unnecessary loops and redundant calculations.
Use forEach, map, filter, and reduce where applicable.
Document Your Code

Write clear comments and use JSDoc for functions and parameters.
Use Version Control

Track code changes with Git or another version control system.
